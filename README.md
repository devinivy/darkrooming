# Darkrooming

## As a monitor
### Setup
  1. Place three trays in the wet area of the darkroom.
  2. Mix **developer** to be no shallower than 1/2-inch deep in the first tray.  Follow the instructions on the bottle/package.
    - Worth noting that there are paper developers and film developers.  It's preferred to use a paper developer like Kodak Dektol, but you should be able to get away with using Kodak HC-110 (dilution A) film developer in a pinch.  Film developers are weaker and make muddier prints with less intense blacks.
    - You can over-develop a print, but it's a rare problem.
  3. Mix **stop bath** to be no shallower than 1/2-inch deep in the middle tray.  Follow the instructions on the bottle.
    - You can also use white vinegar, mixing 1 part vinegar to 4 parts water.
    - You can tell when stop bath is dead by rubbing a little bit between your fingers.  If it feels a little bit greasy, then it's probably time to change the chemical.
    - There may also be leftover stop bath from a previous sessionâ€“ check the containers.
    - You can't over-stop a print.
  4. Mix **fixer** to be no shallower than 1/2-inch deep in the middle tray.  Follow the instructions on the bottle.
    - The bottle/package might indicate the number of square inches of paper that it can handle.  It's somewhat worthwhile to pay attention to this.  Fixer gets "spent" as it collects silver from the paper.  If you fix your print with spent fixer, then some day your print could turn brown.
    - Fixer shouldn't go down the drain.
    - You can't over-fix a print.

### Chemicals
1. Develop (1m30s)
  - Agitate continuously.
  - More like 2-3m for fiber paper.
2. Stop (30s)
  - Agitate 20s.
  - You can't over-stop a print.
3. Fix (3-6min)
  - Agitate the entire first 30s to 1m, then for 10s each following minute.
  - You can't over-fix a print.  An under-fixed print may become discolored or fade with age.
4. Cold water rinse (minimum 10m)
  - More washing for fiber paper.
  - Either with running water or not.  If not...
  > I take the print to the bathroom and give it an initial rinse, then I put the print into a tray and cover it with about 1/4 inch of water. I then rock the dish to and fro 10 times, pour out the water and repeat. Then I repeat with 2 x 20 agitations, then with 2 x 40 agitations. The print is now washed. FB [fiber] paper on the other hand is a different matter, but can be washed by suspending the prints in a tank of water and changing the water several times (say 6 times) during the course of a couple of hours.
